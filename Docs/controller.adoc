Functions for managing inventory statuses include `getAllStatuses`, `getStatusById`, `addStatus`, `updateStatus`, and `deleteStatus`. These handle fetching, adding, updating, and deleting inventory statuses.

== Filters

There are several filter functions, such as `getInventoryByLocation`, `getInventoryByStatus`, `getInventoryByType`, and `getInventoryByQuantity`, which filter the inventory based on specific criteria.

- Ensure environment variables are properly configured for sensitive information such as `JWT_SECRET`.
- Passwords are hashed using `bcryptjs` for security.
- Error handling is implemented to return appropriate status codes and messages.
