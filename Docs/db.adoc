= Database Connection Configuration (last updated 3/12/24)

== Overview

This document explains the `db.js` file in the Inventory Management System API, which configures the PostgreSQL connection using the `pg` library's `Pool` class. 

== Configuration Details

There are two examples of pool configuration in `db.js`:

. The first, commented-out configuration, is for a PostgreSQL database hosted on Render.com. This configuration includes details like `user`, `password`, `host`, `database`, `port`, and SSL settings. SSL is configured to reject unauthorized connections, which is essential for secure database communication.

. The second configuration is for a local PostgreSQL database. It specifies the `user`, `password`, `host`, `database`, and `port` without SSL settings, as SSL is typically not needed for local connections.

== Best Practices for Sensitive Information

[WARNING]
====
Storing sensitive information such as database passwords directly in your codebase is not recommended due to security risks. Instead, consider using environment variables or a secure secret management service to handle such sensitive details. This can be implemented using `dotenv` for local development and appropriate secret management tools in production environments.
====

== Example of Using Environment Variables

[source,js]
----
require('dotenv').config();

const pool = new Pool({
  user: process.env.DB_USER,
  password: process.env.DB_PASSWORD,
  host: process.env.DB_HOST,
  database: process.env.DB_NAME,
  port: process.env.DB_PORT,
  ssl: process.env.DB_SSL ? {
    rejectUnauthorized: false
  } : undefined,
});

module.exports = pool;
----

== Implementation

Include `db.js` in parts of your application where database access is required. The pool object will manage connections to your PostgreSQL database, allowing you to perform queries and transactions.
